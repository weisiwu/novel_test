"My great-grandmother is the strongest phoenix in the Primordial Chaos, yet I find myself having to leave home. The moment I leave, it spans thousands of miles. It's all because my great-grandmother said she wants to crush the Dragon Clan, exterminate the Qilin Clan, and even make the Ancestral Dragon her mount, with the Qilin playing a major role in unifying the world of Primordial Chaos.

I transmigrated here, aware of my great-grandmother's ultimate fate. Therefore, I chose to leave her, wander into a distant land, and enhance my abilities in a place where nobody could find me. As I fled with a bucket in hand, time seemed to lose its meaning during my ageless cultivation.

When I woke up again, the Wutong Forest had expanded significantly. The entire canyon space was filled with vibrant spiritual energy, and I sensed that the area had become brighter. The six phoenixes I had taken into the canyon had formed two teams, eventually pairing off and even giving birth to a nest of phoenix chicks.

Witnessing this scene, a silver-like threat emerged. Just then, the system's prompt sounded again, detecting that the Demon Ancestor Luo Hou was severely injured and about to fall. The host was asked if they wanted to seize the opportunity to kill him. Accepting the mission would attract the attention of the Red Army and gain their favor. Rejecting the mission would reward the host with a divine technique, the Burning Heaven Divine Palm.

The appearance of this mission intrigued me, and the prospect of a top-tier divine technique in the Primordial Chaos made me decide to reject the mission. Immediately after declining, the divine technique, like a sharp blade, entered my mind. Shortly after obtaining the Burning Heaven Divine Palm, the system's prompt sounded again. It conveyed the news that the Red Army had slain the Demon Ancestor Luo Hou, gained immense merit, comprehended the mysteries of creation, and that Jade Butterfly was about to achieve the status of a saint. The host was asked if they wanted to leave the canyon to seek apprenticeship. Accepting the mission would make the host a saint under the Red Army. Rejecting the mission would reward the host with a drop of Pan Gu's essence blood.

At the mention of Pan Gu's essence blood, I was momentarily tempted, but the thought of the immense value of such a precious substance prevailed. I promptly rejected the mission. The system responded by presenting a drop of essence blood. As it appeared, the entire canyon filled with a powerful aura. Without hesitation, I proceeded to refine the essence blood.

During the process, I caught a glimpse of a majestic figure wielding a sharp blade that emitted explosive energy capable of destroying everything. In the midst of this, my aura underwent a tremendous transformation.

Upon complete refinement, my cultivation soared from the realm of Taiyi Xuanxian to the peak of Golden Immortal Ninefold. This sudden leap transcended a major realm, an exhilarating advancement. With this achievement, the subsequent realms included Taiyi Golden Immortal, quasi-Saint, and eventually, Saint. In just a short time, I had reached the pinnacle of the Golden Immortal realm. If time continued, becoming a dominant force in the outside world was inevitable.

Meanwhile, in the external world of the Primordial Chaos, significant changes were occurring. The Red Army's patriarch ascended to the status of a saint, marking the appearance of the first saint in the Primordial Chaos. The entire world was filled with celestial melodies, and auspicious clouds covered the sky. Numerous disciples emerged, and countless powerful beings looked towards the western land.

As the Red Army achieved sanctification, it chose the western land, which had turned into a wasteland after the Demon Ancestor Luo Hou's desperate self-preservation measures during his demise. This decision cast a shadow over the region, a burden that the Red Army willingly undertook.

Amidst the victory, a solemn and indifferent voice echoed throughout the Primordial Chaos. It declared the eternal existence of the saint in the Ninth Heaven, the establishment of the Yunhu Formation, and the emergence of the Primordial Emperor. It also announced the recognition of the Red Army as the leader of the Xuanmen Sect and the inheritor of the essence of Pan Gu. The world resonated with this proclamation.

Three thousand years later, as I cultivated within the canyon, the system prompted me about the opportunity to accept disciples and occupy a seat at the Purple Cloud Palace. The host could choose between acquiring a spiritual treasure from the Heavenly Dao (Post-Heaven) or a tyrannical blood treasure from the Primordial Chaos (Pre-Heaven) by rejecting the mission.

Feng Tianyu, the woman wielding the Burning Heaven Feather Fan, showed a hint of disdain. Having been in the harsh land of the Primordial Chaos, she knew that the Red Army's calculations were not simple. Becoming his disciple would undoubtedly involve schemes and manipulations throughout countless years.

As I contemplated the situation within the canyon, I shrugged my shoulders and said to the system, "I reject."

With the refusal of the mission, a scorching aura enveloped me, and a feather fan burning with red flames materialized in front of me. The Burning Heaven Feather Fan was crafted from countless firebird feathers in the Primordial Chaos, infused with boundless flames. This divine fan could summon an endless sea of fire and possessed the power to incinerate heaven and sea.

Grasping the feather fan, information flooded my mind, revealing that this fan was exceptionally suitable for me. With the Magnetic Treasure in hand, my combat power increased significantly.

Now, having reached the pinnacle of the astonishing realm, I was just a step away from entering the Taiyi Golden Immortal realm. As time passed, and as my body underwent drastic changes, I abruptly opened my eyes. A golden light shot out from my eyes as my body's aura explosively changed. The previous aura of peak Immortal had erupted in a matter of seconds, breaking through to the realm of Taiyi Golden Immortal.

"Haha, I finally broke through to the realm of Taiyi Golden Immortal!" I exclaimed, feeling the surging power coursing through my body. The sense of satisfaction overwhelmed me. Even the thought of leaving the canyon to unleash this newfound formidable power crossed my mind."
